Finally, we'll do a bit more work on APIs.

So, we've at this stage used the term API quite a lot, and we've not actually been wrong in any instance we've used it.

API stands for Application Programming Interface. In the context of APIs, the word Application refers to any software with a distinct function. 

Interface can be thought of as a contract of service between two applications. This contract defines how the two communicate with each other using requests and responses.
