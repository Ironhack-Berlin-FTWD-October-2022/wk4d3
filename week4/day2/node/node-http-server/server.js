// Here we’ve added a callback. This time, we are using the new arrow function syntax but it’s still a callback function. This callback function receives two parameters from the HTTP package: request and response. These are both objects that represent the request we received from a client and the response we will send back from our server.

// The response has methods that allow us to control what a client receives from us. Right now clients will always get the same thing: Hello, world!.
